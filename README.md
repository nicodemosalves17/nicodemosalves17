Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 34-year-old Brazilian tech enthusiast currently living in Portugal. I'm on a journey to learn programming, with a focus on Python.

I have basic knowledge of C# and advanced experience in Excel. In addition, I have solid experience in data analysis using Power BI, which allows me to transform data into valuable insights.

I'm currently developing a program in Python, where I apply and expand my knowledge. My motivation is to constantly learn and evolve, always looking for new challenges.

Here on GitHub, you'll find my projects and experiments, where I share what I've been learning. Feel free to explore and follow my evolution.

Let's connect and exchange knowledge! ðŸš€
